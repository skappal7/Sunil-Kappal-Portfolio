# [Project 1: Object-Detection Using Tiny Yolo in R](https://github.com/skappal7/Tiny-Yolo-Object-Detection)
In this project I created a quick object detection model with a simple code block leveraging Tiny Yolo. Yolo (You Only Look Once) object detector is often cited as being one of the fastest deep-learning based object detectors.
